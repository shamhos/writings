<h1>About me</h1>

I'm a data enthusiast, history lover, and spicy ramen junkie from Dallas, TX, currently an undergraduate at Duke University in Durham, NC.
I enjoy building models and applying computation to investigate interesting economic problems. Last summer, I researched electricity access in developing countries using deep learning under Dr. Kyle Bradbury of the [Duke Energy Data Analytics Lab](https://energy.duke.edu/research/energy-data). In summer 2018, I'll be a Software Engineer Intern at MaxPoint Interactive in Austin, TX. 

I like learning new things that involve numbers and technology, and applying what I learn to try and predict other things. This blog is part of my effort to document what I try and, hopefully, learn along the way. Welcome to my blog!
